# openscad-floyd-rose-blocks
A configurable OpenSCAD script that creates STLs you can use to disable up and down bridge motion on a floating bridge guitar.

The default parameters are based on what I needed to block off my Ibanez RG550 with an Edge tremolo.

I could have done all this in 5 minutes with Solidworks, but I decided to take several of hours and write this script instead...

Currently, this script only works on desktop distrobutions of OpenSCAD. I would like to port it to OpenJSCAD, which has a nice online viewer.
Right now, OpenJSCAD has poor OpenSCAD support, and OpenSCAD.net is poor too.
